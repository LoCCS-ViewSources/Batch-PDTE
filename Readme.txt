# Shoud install "seal" from https://github.com/microsoft/SEAL first

# Please follow the compilation command of the following file to get the tabular data in the paper:

batch_pdte_single_core/Readme.txt

level_up_pdte_single_core/Readme.txt

sortinghat_pdte_single_core/Readme.txt

# note

1. "batch_pdte_single_core" is our main work.

2. "level_up_pdte_single_core" and "level_up_pdte_multi_core" from 
   https://github.com/RasoulAM/private-decision-tree-evaluation 

   "sortinghat_pdte_single_core" from 
   https://github.com/KULeuven-COSIC/SortingHat

   To compare with our solution, we only made modifications to the input and output, which did not affect the main performance.
